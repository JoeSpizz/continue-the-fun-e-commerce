# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# https://api.boardgameatlas.com/api/search?limit=100&skip=0&pretty=true&client_id=cXouSHFcOH
# use this for seeding board games. You'll want to run multiple and up the skip by 100 each time to get full list.
